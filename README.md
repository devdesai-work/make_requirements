# make_requirements
Want to make a github repository but feeling lazy to make the requirements.txt file, which makes for a standard git repo.

I got you covered just run this file in your command promt as:
```
pythom main.py -f "project_directory_location"
```
and you'll have the requirements.txt file ready in your directory.

Happy cooding !! :D
